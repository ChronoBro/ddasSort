Program for sorting NSCL DDAS data that has been unbuilt to include only one ddaschannel per DDASEvent and the resulting ROOT tree is time ordered. 

The code has been written with the functionality to extract other data types from ROOT trees in mind. 

Requires [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/)

To get started:

    `make root`
    `make`

**Requires [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/)**

Program for sorting NSCL DDAS data that has been unbuilt to include only one ddaschannel per DDASEvent and the resulting ROOT tree is time ordered. A ROOT script, UnbuildData.C, is provided to unbuild ROOT trees that have been generated by ddasdumper.

The code has been written with the functionality to extract other data types from ROOT trees in mind. 

To get started:

    make root
    make


With the latest version, sort5, one can use a configuration file using [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) to point to the data and setup all of the detector objects. This is parsed using [cpptoml](https://github.com/skystrife/cpptoml). Sample configuration and calibration files are provided.

Outline for creating Analysis tools
-----------------------------------

RBDDTrace:
 -Need to unit test and make sure everything is working properly

RBDDChannel:
 -Turn ddasDet class into RBDDChannel class (port functionality over/rewrite certain things)
 -For example of above: No need to have a vector of events in ddasDet, since each detector should 
  only fire once in each trigger (if not then something is wrong!)
  
-Put virtual "unpack" function in RBDDChannel class that will be called in RBDDTriggered
   -If function is virtual then it will need to be defined in inherited classes, e.g. RBDDASChannel

RBDDTrigger:
 -Implement "buffer" of events (vector<RBDDChannel>) in RBDDTriggered class
  -Ultimately want to create good "triggerSearch" function that returns a list of events in coincidence with defined trigger
